# UI

The visual identity, theming, and the component library. Components take domain
types and never know which plugin produced them.

## Tamagui

The app is built with [Tamagui](https://tamagui.dev) 2.7.7 on its `v5` preset.
Every `@tamagui/*` package is pinned to the same exact version — Tamagui is not
tied to an Expo SDK, so nothing else keeps them in step.

There is exactly **one theme entry point**: `src/tamagui.config.ts`. Colours,
spacing and type all come from there; nothing sits beside it.

- **Dark only.** A cool blue-grey "ink" for surfaces and a single teal accent
  for primary actions and selection. No borrowed brand colours.
- **Shorthands.** The v5 preset only accepts the short form of a style prop:
  `bg`, `p`, `px`, `rounded`, `items`, `justify`, `self`, `maxW`…
- **Media queries are min-width**: `$sm` ≥ 640, `$md` ≥ 768, `$lg` ≥ 1024,
  `$xl` ≥ 1280. Card sizes and column counts come from the viewport, so the
  same screens will stretch to a TV.
- **Animations** use the v5 CSS driver: CSS on the web, React Native's Animated
  on devices, from one import.
- **Icons** are Lucide, imported one file at a time
  (`@tamagui/lucide-icons-2/icons/ChevronRight`) so the full set never ships.

## Native where it counts

The tab bar is the platform's own — iOS tabs, Material 3 navigation on
Android — and so are the stack headers and switches. They are drawn natively,
so they take colours resolved from the Tamagui theme. In a browser the tabs
become a top navigation bar, which is also each tab's header.

## On the web

`src/app/_layout.tsx` imports `@tamagui/core/reset.css`. Without it the
browser's own styles leak in — button padding alone squeezes every switch.

Tamagui 2.7.7 warns in development that an `AlertDialogContent` "requires a
description" even when it has one; its check runs before the dialog's portal
mounts. The dialog is correctly described — check `aria-describedby` in the DOM.

## What the screens show today

Media and Videos show the layout — hero, shelves, one tab per source — with
skeleton cards, because plugins cannot list titles yet. Settings is complete:
profiles, PIN lock, and every plugin's configuration, rendered from the
plugin's own manifest.
